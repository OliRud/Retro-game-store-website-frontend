              <p><i>Retro Lair, the neon sign bathes me in its familiar glow. Dusting cartridges, I breathe in the scent of nostalgia â€“ a daily ritual. More than selling games,
                it's about sparking memories. A kid scores a Game Boy gem, a student hunts for "Battletoads," while veterans share secret button combos. Tournaments crackle with competition,
                retro PC builds hum, and singalongs erupt over classic soundtracks.
                Retro Lair isn't a store, it's a community. Here, we sell nostalgia, one controller click at a time.</i></p>
